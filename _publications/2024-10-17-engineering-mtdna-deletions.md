abstract: 'Recent breakthroughs in the genetic manipulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have enabled
the precise introduction of base substitutions and the effective removal of genomes carrying
harmful mutations. However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe
mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells.
Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-
expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we
used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a ~3.5 kb mtDNA
deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a
critical threshold of ~75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS
proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media.'
