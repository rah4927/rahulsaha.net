abstract: "We present LLMSTEP, a tool for integrating a language model into the Lean proof assistant. LLMSTEP is a Lean 4 tactic that sends a user's proof state to a server hosting a language model. The language model generates suggestions, which are checked in Lean and displayed to a user in their development environment."
