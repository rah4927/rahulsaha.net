I am first year PhD student at UT Austin, working in the **Trustworthy and Intelligent Systems Lab** (Trishul) under Swarat Chaudhuri. I am interested in developing intelligent systems for mathematics and other scientific domains. Previously I have worked on number theory of quadratic forms, and single-cell computational genomics.

# NEWS 
* My advisor Swarat Chaudhuri and collaborators just released a position paper - [Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16075).

# RESEARCH INTERESTS

How did complex mathematical ability arise from millions of years of evolution? How are humans capable of discovering relativity, or proving the 290 theorem? From both cognitive and mathematical perspectives, this is a very compelling question to me. For my doctoral research, I want to study this problem from the angle of automatic theorem proving, discovery, and program synthesis.

- **Automatic Theorem Proving**. How do we train agents to rigorously prove mathematical statements? Most popular methods currently involve guided tree search with signals from an LLM, but there are many unanswered questions on sample complexity, synthetic data generation, and scaling laws.  
- **Automatic Discovery**. How do humans come up with newer concepts in mathematics and science? This is a generative AI problem but the twist is that the space is highly discrete. 
- **Program Synthesis**. How can one build reliable, safe, and formally verifiable programs at scale? LLMs are expensive and not reliable when codebases scale up to tens of thousands of lines of code. Tackling this will require coming up with newer algorithms. 

# APPLICATIONS 

I believe that the fruits of my research will empower us to discover newer frontiers of science, empower mathematicians with the ability to ask and answer deeper questions, boost productivity of scientists, and help humanity towards solving some of the hardest problems.
