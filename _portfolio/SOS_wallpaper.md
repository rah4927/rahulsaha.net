While I was working with desmos, I plotted the graph of the equation\
\
⌊x⌋² + ⌊y⌋² ≡ 0 (**mod p**)
\
\
for various integers p. It turns out that this equation has non trivial
solutions only if p is of the form 4k + 1. This is given by Fermat\'s
Sum of Squares theorem, which states that -1 is a quadratic residue if
and only if\
\
p ≡ 1 (**mod 4**)

Since I liked the interesting pattern depicted above, I decided to do a
contour plot of the equation on python for a desktop wallpaper. I used
Nord\'s color palette to customize matplotlib\'s default color scheme.
Below are a couple of examples.
